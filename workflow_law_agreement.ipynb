            "--- Section 1 ---\n",
            "Original: **1. DUTIES:** The CONSULTANT agrees to perform specific services, detailed in Exhibit A (Scope of Services), to the reasonable satisfaction of the COMMISSION.  Key personnel, listed in Section 1B, cannot be replaced without the COMMISSION's prior written consent. The CONSULTANT must submit detailed progress reports with each invoice and meet with the COMMISSION's Contract Manager as needed to discuss progress.\n",
            "Tone: Formal\n",
            "Bias: Yes, there is a potential bias in this section towards the Commission. The terms suggest that the consultant's duties are subject to the \"reasonable satisfaction\" of the Commission, implying that the Commission holds significant control over the consultant's performance and work quality. Additionally, the requirement for prior written consent before replacing key personnel may limit the consultant's autonomy and decision-making power. Furthermore, the frequent meetings with the Contract Manager could potentially create a power imbalance between the parties.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Section 2 ---\n",
            "Original: **2. COMPENSATION:** The COMMISSION will pay the CONSULTANT a total not exceeding a specified amount for time and materials, as detailed in Exhibit B (Fee Schedule). Reimbursable expenses must adhere to GSA regulations. Progress payments will be made monthly, contingent upon satisfactory service and allowable costs. Payments will only be made after approval of work and after execution of this agreement. Milestone cost estimates in Exhibit B cannot be exceeded without prior written approval. Itemized invoices, including detailed labor and expense breakdowns, progress reports, and expenditure reports, are to be submitted no later than 45 calendar days after work completion. Final invoices must be submitted within 60 days of work acceptance. Salary increases resulting from prevailing wage changes are reimbursable.\n",
            "Tone: Formal, Businesslike\n",
            "Bias: No bias detected in the provided text. It appears to be a standard contractual agreement for a consulting service, detailing terms such as payment structure, expenses, and reporting requirements. The language used is neutral and professional.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Section 3 ---\n",
            "Original: **3. TERM:** This Agreement is effective upon approval by the COMMISSION's governing board and notification to proceed by the COMMISSION's Contract Manager. It will end on a specified date unless terminated or extended earlier by amendment. The Agreement is not binding until fully executed and approved by the COMMISSION's board.\n",
            "Tone: Formal\n",
            "Bias: No bias detected. This section appears to be neutral and objective, as it simply describes the conditions for the effectiveness and duration of an agreement.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Section 4 ---\n",
            "Original: **4. EARLY TERMINATION:** The COMMISSION may terminate this Agreement for convenience with 30 days' written notice, paying allowable costs incurred to date and reasonably necessary termination costs. The COMMISSION may also terminate for CONSULTANT default (e.g., bankruptcy, breach of contract). The CONSULTANT may terminate with 120 days' written notice.  In cases of default, the CONSULTANT is liable for all reasonable costs incurred by the COMMISSION, including reprocurement costs.\n",
            "Tone: Formal, Contractual\n",
            "Bias: Yes, there is a bias in this section. The bias is towards the Commission as it allows them to terminate the agreement at their convenience with only 30 days' notice and without causing any financial loss, while requiring the Consultant to bear all reasonable costs associated with the termination if the Consultant defaults or breaches the contract. In contrast, the Consultant can only terminate the agreement after a longer notice period of 120 days, and even in cases where the Commission terminates for convenience, they are still required to pay allowable costs incurred to date and reasonably necessary termination costs. This implies an unequal power dynamic between the two parties, with the Commission holding more favorable terms for themselves.\n",
